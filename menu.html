                    <p>Our evening menu is inspired by the Punjabi (but made in Hove, actually!). The philosophy of life for many Punjabis is to eat, drink and make merry. They are lively people who are extremely fond of eating good food and we offer you just that. Our delicious curries and tandoori feasts are full of Indian spices and marinades with select prime cuts of meat, and a buzzing atmosphere ~ a place to socialise over drinks and sharing food.</p>
